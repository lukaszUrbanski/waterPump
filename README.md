My engineering work!! 

This is project of water pump controller is built as a single-board device based on the ESP32, 
with an L298N DC motor driver. The measurement system consists of a 12V centrifugal pump, 
a YF-S201 liquid flow sensor, and a 2bar 5V resistive pressure sensor. The pump operation 
is controlled using a PID regulator to maintain the desired pressure. 
The controller also includes protection against excessive pressure and dry running.
